# Python Practice & Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey in learning Python programming.

It contains structured exercises, mini-projects, and experiments covering:

- Core Python fundamentals
- Control flow and loops
- Functions and modular programming
- Recursion (e.g., Tower of Hanoi)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Working with files and basic data persistence
- GUI basics (Tkinter)
- Problem-solving challenges

The purpose of this repository is to build strong programming fundamentals and prepare for more advanced topics such as data science and AI.
